We fail to see the collective violence done upon the victim by the community. This book teaches you to see through the lies told by myths and find the innocence in all victims.",

        "McLuhan is a genius. He examines a technology (or a medium if you will) and asks, 'how does this change the way we interact with the world both as individuals and as a society?'. Take the lightbulb for example. We don't really think about the lightbulb as a medium but it is. It transforms how we interact with the world. It detached our productive hours from the cycle of the sun. You can read at night now. Friday night football is possible because you aren't strictly limited to the daytime hours. Another good example is the transition from the bicycle to the car to the airplane. When you travel on a bike, you are in your direct environment. You're much more integrated. In a car, you are an observer, further removed. In a plane, you don't even start traveling until you touch down at your destination. You have teleported to your location and bypassed the whole 'traveling' part of the journey.",

      title: "Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World",
      author: "René Girard",
      description:
        "A beast of a book. Girard hypothesizes that all human culture and institutions are founded on an original sin, the collective murder of a victim by the community. He believes human desire is mimetic; we chose our desires by copying the desires of those around us. This inevitably draws us into conflict. The enlightenment view of the world is that when everyone is at each other's throats, they will sit down and draft a peaceful resolution to the conflict. This is fantasy. What actually happens and has always happened is that there is one amongst the group who is more 'other' than the rest. This individual is singled out as the cause of the conflict. The community collectively murders or exiles the victim. The truth, and the thing hidden since the foundation of the world, is that the victim is innocent. They are not solely responsible for the disharmony in the community. Myth conceals this truth. Often it takes the shape of 1) a crisis of undifferentiation plunges the community into a crisis, 2) the community realizes that a newcomer/outsider is responsible for the chaos, 3) the outsider is expelled or killed and peace is restored, 4) the outsider (now victim) is sacralyzed as they were the cause and cure of the crisis. This is the scapegoat mechanism and it is the foundation of all human culture. Girard believes that the Gospels alone reveal the truth that the victim is innocent by telling the story from the perspective of the victim.",

      description:
        "A weird book for us moderns because we do not spend any time thinking about things like ritual sacrificial violence. The existential threat for early human communities was reciprocal violence. Your neighbor kills your brother, you kill his, the cycle repeats, the community is destroyed. Ritualization of the violence is a containment policy. It short circuits the cycle of violence. And because it is effective at preventing the destruction of the community, it is sacralized. The ritual becomes a religious act. Our modern justice system serves a similar function. Its most essential purpose is to stop the cycle of reciprocal violence. It is good but not perfect.",

        "A comprehensive guide to the AWS DynamoDB service. There is an interesting piece of background where Alex talks about how it used to be the case that storage was in really short supply and compute was marginal. This is part of why SQL databases are structured the way they are. They are normalized to save space. Running a JOIN is expensive in terms of compute but cheap in terms of storage. DynamoDB flips this on its head. Storage is relatively cheap and compute is relatively expensive. This is why you often denormalize your data in DynamoDB. You want to minimize the number of operations you need to perform to get the data you want. This book is a great resource for learning how to structure your data in DynamoDB.",

Companies had grown in size and complexity and it was no longer the world of the apple cart vendor. You need managers to run your enterprise. So in that sense, it is not 'founder capitalism'. It is also not 'worker socialism'. The means of production are in the hands of the managers. It is 'managerial capitalism'. Today, with the Internet and AI you can massively leverage yourself. I think Instagram had like 13 employees when it was acquired by Facebook for $1 Billion. We will probably see the one-person, billion dollar company before too long. I think that will mark the end of the managerial era.",
