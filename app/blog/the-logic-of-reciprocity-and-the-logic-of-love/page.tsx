        This is an outline of where we came from, how we got here, and where we
        need to go if we are to live peacefully together on this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Human desire is imitative, or mimetic. I figure out what I "want" by
        observing my neighbor and imitating his desires. If many other people
        desire the same object, I take that as even more proof that the object
        truly is desirable. It signals to me that I "chose" well.
      </p>
      <p>
        We naturally understand where this leads. If the object is abundant,
        like apples at a grocery store, this confluence of desire is not a big
        deal. There are actually enough apples to go around and everyone&apos;s
        desires can be fulfilled. But if the object is scarce, we risk conflict.
        The love triangle is a good example of this. There is no equivalent
        substitute for the romantic partner that the two competitors are vying
        for. No one else will do. Or a resource-rich piece of land that sits in
        a disputed region between two rival nations. They cannot both have it.
      </p>
      <p className="italic">Mimetic desire is the father of conflict.</p>
      <p>
        Imitation often produces the conflict and then fans the flames of the
        resulting violence. We have a word for this:{" "}
        <span className="italic">vengeance</span>. This is retaliatory, or
        reciprocal, violence against another who has caused harm to me. The
        biblical framing here is useful:{" "}
        <span className="italic">an eye for an eye</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reciprocal violence is self perpetuating and has a runaway effect. First
        you kill me, then my brother kills you, then your brother kills my
        brother, then my father kills your brother, then your father kills my
        father. And it goes on and on until nothing is left. This dynamic was an
        existential threat to early human communities. Without a way to stop
        cyclical violence, they would be torn apart. This is the origin of
        ritual, religion, and prohibitions. All human institutions have the same
        original purpose. To contain violence. They do this imperfectly of
        course, but they succeeded in preventing our extinction by our own
        bloody hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a logic to vengeance. You feel it when you are in the heat of
        it. Of course the other should pay for the wrong that they have done to
        you. It is incredibly difficult to zoom out from that moment of passion.
        Over thousands of years, we have built up cultural institutions that
        help us cool off in these moments. Modern justice systems relegate the
        power of punishment and violence to a force outside of the original
        conflict. They say, yes, the aggressor will face punishment but not by
        your hand, oh aggrieved party. This is all in hopes of stopping cycles
        of violence from perpetuating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our institutions improved over time and for a while it seemed like the
        existential risk of reciprocal violence could be contained. Even at the
        scale of continent-spanning world wars, there was the belief that the
        conflict must come to an end. War could be extremely destructive, even
        existential for the loser, but the idea that entire world could be
        destroyed was out of the picture.
      </p>
      <p>
        The proliferation of nuclear weapons plunges us back into the world of
        risk of existential reciprocal violence. Our technology has advanced
        faster than our moral evolution and that gap presents an existential
        danger. Yes we have justice systems and laws and even imaginary things
        like &quot;international law&quot;, but we have zero defenses, zero
        institutions, that protect us from reciprocal nuclear war.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might say, well what about nuclear deterrence? Hasn&apos;t that
        strategy worked so far? And I would say yes, it has but it cannot hold.
        We got extremely lucky with the Cuban Missile Crisis. The first stone is
        always the hardest one to throw because it has no model. Once you see
        one or two rocks fly overhead, it becomes trivial to throw the third.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are at a tipping point. For the first time in history, we have the
        power to destroy ourselves completely. There is no cultural institution,
        no antibody to save us from the violence that we can do to one another
        in this new world. It used to be the case that you could temporarily end
        violence with an overwhelming response of violence. We fly at a
        different altitude now. There is no way to nuclear exchange your way to
        peace. There just won&apos;t be anything left and the point is moot.
      </p>
      <p>
        We rarely think about the apocalypse but when we do we tend to imagine
        it as the end of the world brought about by the hand of God. What is
        probably more realistic is the end of the world brought about by the
        hand of man. It is probably just nuclear war, that is sufficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only way out of this impasse is beyond radical. It is to turn the
        other cheek. It is to love your enemy so much that you refuse to destroy
        them. We are in an incredibly vulnerable position. To turn the other
        cheek is to put yourself at the mercy of your adversary. The only hope
        is to kickoff a chain of positive imitation in the direction of
        non-violence. This is like throwing stones in reverse. You must be the
        first to lay down your weapon, and should you be so lucky, by doing so
        you will have inspired your adversary to do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am aware of how &quot;pie in the sky&quot; it sounds to say that the
        way to prevent the apocalypse is to love your neighbor and love your
        enemies but I do believe this is the only viable path. Reciprocal
        violence certainly will not prevent annihilation. It cannot,
        definitionally and in practice. Rational, enlightenment thinking
        won&apos;t save you either. It is easy to sit down and draft a nice
        resolution in peace time. It is precisely when you need that type of
        conflict resolution the most, when all stand upon the brink of war, that
        rational thought is nowhere to be found. It disappears at the very
        moment you need it the most. As mentioned before, you cannot assemble an
        overwhelming surge of force in a nuclear war. The floor is too high, it
        doesn&apos;t much matter if it is 10 nuclear warheads or 100, no one
        will be left standing at the end of it all.
      </p>
      <p>
        To survive in the new world, it will take a universal refusal to engage
        in violence. We have arrived at the crossroads where we quite literally
        must decide whether we will live in harmony with each other and have
        Heaven on Earth or descend into unlimited human violence and the
        apocalypse.
