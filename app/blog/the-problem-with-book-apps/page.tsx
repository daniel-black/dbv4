        Goodreads is a classic example of a product that sounds good in theory
        but fails miserably in practice. Applied to a different medium (showbiz
        baby), the Goodreads formula actually works spectacularly well. You can
        see this in the success of apps like Letterboxd. Taking a closer look at
        each medium makes it crystal clear why one succeeds where the other
        fails.

      <p>
        Let&apos;s start with Movies. In the McLuhan sense, movies are a red hot
        medium. You sit back passively and let the sensory experience envelop
        you. They are are also experienced socially. You and all you buddies buy
        tickets and experience the spectacle together. Afterwards is the
        debrief. You throw out critiques, praise, theories, etc. The medium{" "}
        <i>wants</i> to be shared and spoken about. There is also the temporal
        aspect. It only takes about two hours to watch a movie. Even if you are
        at home, you often finish the film in one sitting. There is no analog to
        the experience of reading a slow book where it drags and drags for
        weeks. For a week or two when a new movie comes out, it crests the
        cultural zeitgeist. It becomes a running part of the discourse - people
        just want to talk about it. All of these characteristics lend themselves
        incredibly well to a social, Letterboxd type of experience.

        Books are quite the opposite. The experience is slow, single-player, and
        highly disjounted. The Goodreads UX of{" "}
        <i>&quot;when did you start reading this book?&quot;</i>,{" "}
        <i>&quot;what page are you on now?&quot;</i>,{" "}
        <i>&quot;when did you finish this book?&quot;</i> is incredibly
        cumbersome. It will never be as clean as clicking the
        &quot;watched&quot; button next to a movie poster. It can&apos;t be.
        Books are a solitary experience. Yes, you might read a book as part of a
        book club but still the actual experience of <i>reading</i> is done by
        you and you alone. Outside of maybe the Harry Potter books when they
        were coming out and had all the hype, when can you honestly say that
        everyone was reading the same book at the same time? That just does not
        happen for this medium. I might be reading a book from 150 years ago -
        how many people on the planet are simultaneously reading that book? Not
        that many, certainly not enough to sustain a vibrant, social
        meta-discourse.

        This is the difference. Apps like Letterboxd feel fun, social, topical,
        and cultural. This is because movies really are all those things. The
        experience of using Goodreads feels like volunteering for a sad and
        tired data entry job. It is simply a chore. I think this is the biggest
        mistake that &quot;book apps&quot; make. They try to bolt on a social
        experience to a medium that is, by its very nature, solitary.
      </p>
      <p>
        This opens up an interesting line of questioning. What would a book app
        look like if it were built upon the understanding that reading is a
        single-player experience?
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not going to answer that question here but I think it is a fruitful
        avenue to investigate.
